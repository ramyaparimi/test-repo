Workflow rdfuns often reuse the same outputs or downloaded dependencies from one run to another. For example, package and dependency management tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, and Yarn keep a local cache of downloaded dependencies.

Jobs on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners start in a clean virtual environment and must download dependencies each time, causing increased network utilizatio n, longer runtime, and increased cost. To help speed up the time it takes to recreate these files, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can cache dependenci es you frequently use in workflows.  

To cache dependencies for a job, you'll need to use {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s cache action. The action retrieves a cache identified by a unique key. For more info rmation, see actions/cache.

If you are caching R uby gems, instead consider using the Ruby maintained action, which can cache bundle installs on initiation. For more information, see ruby/setup-ruby.
