## Browser troubleshooting

If you encounter issues using codespaces in a browser that is not Chromium-based, try switching to a Chromium-based browser, or check for known issues with your browser in the `microsoft/vscode` repository by searching for issues labeled with the name of your browser, such as [`firefox`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirefox) or [`safari`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari).

If you encounter issues using codespaces in a Chromium-based browser, you can check if you're experiencing another known issue with {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} in the [`microsoft/vscode`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) repository.

Here's an example _FUNDING.yml_ file:

```
github: [octocat, surftocat]
patreon: octocat
tidelift: npm/octo-package
custom: ["https://www.paypal.me/octocat", octocat.com]
```

{% note %}

**Note:** If a custom URL in an array includes `:`, you must wrap the URL in quotes. For example, `"https://www.paypal.me/octocat"`.

{% endnote %}

You can create a default sponsor button for your organization or user account. For more information, see "[Creating a default community health file](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

{% note %}

Funding links provide a way for open source projects to receive direct financial support from their community. We donâ€™t support the use of funding links for other purposes, such as for advertising, or supporting political, community, or charity groups. If you have questions about whether your intended use is supported, please contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}.

{% endnote %}

With the `in` qualifier you can restrict your search to the repository name, repository description, contents of the README file, or any combination of these. When you omit this qualifier, only the repository name and description are searched.
